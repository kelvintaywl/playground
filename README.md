Playground
==========

Playground is a proof-of-concept project showcasing what is possibly good user-centric UI design.
Because User Happiness is not a myth.

# <a name="get-started"></a>Get Started

To view all examples in this project, simply run a simple web server from this project folder.

## For Mac / Linux users, 

1. clone this project into your local environment.

2. from the terminal, get to the project folder

```
$ cd playground
```

3. You should have Python preinstalled. Great! Simply run the web server via Python:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

4. By default, SimpleHTTPServer runs in port 8000. Point your browser to (http://localhost:8000)

# <a name="forms"></a>HTML Forms

> Proof-of-concept Example [to be updated with Codepen link]()

HTML forms are the glue to I/O between the user and the server, when we talk about web apps.
How can we try to ensure form inputs are less painful?

Key points:
- Move away from a prescriptive approach (i.e., input validation) to a more preventive approach (due to good UI/UX)
- "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) should apply in forms too.
