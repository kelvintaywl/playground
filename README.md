# <a name="forms"></a>HTML Forms

> [View Demo](http://user-happiness.herokuapp.com/)

HTML forms are the glue to I/O between the user and the server, when we talk about web apps.
How can we try to ensure form inputs are less painful?

Key points:
- Move away from a prescriptive approach (i.e., input validation) to a more preventive approach (due to good UI/UX)
- "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) should apply in forms too.
